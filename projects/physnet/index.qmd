Physical networks are networks of tangible components, in which nodes and edges are embedded in physical space and subject to constraints such as volume exclusion [[@dehmamy2018structural]]. 
Examples include biological neural networks, vascular systems, porous media, and granular materials.
Advances in imaging technologies and accelerated 3D reconstruction by ML/AI have enabled to obtain detailed three-dimensional maps of such complex systems, providing new opportunities to study general organizing principles for tangible complex systems.

In recent years, the physical embedding of networks has been shown to give rise to emergent phenomena, including entanglement [[@liu2021isotopy, @glover2024measuring]], bundling [@bonamassa2024logarithmic], jamming [@posfai2024impact], and correlations between node degree and node volume [@pete2024physical].

For my PhD thesis, I am exploring the spectral and topological properties of physical networks and their dynamical implications.
