Last week, I participated in the [IceLab Camp](https://www.umu.se/en/icelab/career-and-education/stress-response-modeling-graduate-research-school/icelab-camp/), an interdisciplinary workshop which took place in Umeå, Sweden between 23 and 26 September 2025.
The workshop was hosted at the [Integrated Science Lab (IceLab)](https://www.umu.se/en/icelab/), [Umeå University](https://www.umu.se/en/).

I am grateful for the organizers, Gabrielle Beans and [Martin Rosvall](https://www.martinrosvall.com/), as well as the fellow participants.
