In particular, my PhD project is centered around the spectral properties of physical Laplacians defined as node-weighted graph Laplacians that incorporate the physicality of nodes into combinatorial Laplacian. The ongoing projects include eigenmode delocalization in physical Laplacians and synchronization in networks of spin Hall nano-oscillators. I am supervised by Prof. Márton Pósfai and Prof. János Kertész.\nBefore starting my PhD, I completed Master of Science in Mathematics at Queen Mary University of London, with dissertation work on higher-order network dynamics in the presence of triadic interactions under the supervision of Prof. Ginestra Bianconi. I earned Bachelor of Engineering in Applied Physics at Hokkaido University in Sapporo, Japan, with thesis titled the bifractal property of fractal scale-free networks (supervised by Prof. Kousuke Yakubo).\n※日本語のプロファイルはこちらを参照して下さい．"

    "text": "Physical Networks\nPhysical networks are networks of tangible objects, in which nodes and edges are embedded in physical space and subject to constraints such as volume exclusion [(Dehmamy, Milanlouei, and Barabási 2018)]. Examples include biological neural networks, vascular systems, porous media, and granular materials [(Blagojević and Pósfai 2024)]. Advances in imaging technologies and accelerated reconstruction by ML/AI have recently made it possible to obtain detailed three-dimensional maps of such complex systems, providing new opportunities for studying physical networks.\nIn recent years, the physical embedding of networks has been shown to give rise to emergent phenomena, including entanglement [(Liu, Dehmamy, and Barabási 2021), (Glover and Barabási 2024)], bundling (Bonamassa et al. 2024), jamming (Pósfai et al. 2024), and correlations between node degree and node volume (Pete et al. 2024).\nFor my PhD thesis, I am exploring the spectral and topological properties of physical networks, as well as the dynamical processes that unfold on them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocalization\n\n\n\nComing soon…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSynchronization\n\n\n\nComing soon…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMagnetization\n\n\n\nComing soon…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntanglement\n\n\n\nComing soon…"

    "section": "Fractal Scale-Free Networks",
    "text": "Fractal Scale-Free Networks\nA network is fractal (with respect to shortest-path lengths) if the minimum number of subgraphs (boxes) of diameter l_{\\textup{B}} required to cover the network scales as \\begin{equation}\n  N_{\\textup{B}}(l_{\\textup{B}}) \\sim l_{\\textup{B}}^{-D_{\\textup{f}}}\n\\end{equation} where D_{\\textup{f}} is the fractal dimension of the network (Song, Havlin, and Makse 2005). In fractal networks, the average path lengths also scales as the power of the network size, \\begin{equation}\n  \\langle l \\rangle \\sim N^{1/D_{\\textup{f}}}.\n\\end{equation} While many empirical networks exhibit the small-world property, where the average path lengths scales logarithmically with the number of nodes (corresponding to the absence of characteristic scales, i.e., D_{\\textup{f}} \\to \\infty), the fractal property can still hold at length scales shorter than the network’s characteristic size. Detecting this scaling through shortest paths, however, is often challenging because most real networks lack a sufficiently large diameter.\nFractal networks are of particular interest because their structure gives rise to distinctive features, such as long-range degree correlations manifested in hub repulsion (Rozenfeld et al. 2008).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBifractality\n\n\n\nWhen scale-free and fractal properties coexist, a broad class of networks exhibits bifractality, characterized by two distinct local fractal dimensions, d_{\\textup{f}}^{\\min} and d_{\\textup{f}}^{\\max} that depend on position within the network (Yamamoto and Yakubo 2023). In particular, consider a fractal scale-free network in which, under renormalization, the number of nodes \\nu_{\\textup{B}} in a supernode (subgraph) of diameter l_{\\textup{B}} is proportional to the degree k_{\\textup{B}} of that supernode (i.e., the number of adjacent subgraphs): \\begin{equation}\n  \\nu_{\\textup{B}} \\propto k_{\\textup{B}}.\n\\end{equation} Under this condition, the network exhibits two local fractal dimensions (equivalently, Hölder exponents): \\begin{equation}\n    d_{\\textup{f}}^{\\max} = D_{\\textup{f}}, \\quad d_{\\textup{f}}^{\\min} = D_{\\textup{f}} \\left(\\frac{\\gamma-2}{\\gamma-1}\\right),\n\\end{equation} where \\gamma is the exponent of the degree distribution and D_{\\textup{f}} is the global fractal dimension of the network.\nExtensive analytical and numerical calculations for both deterministic and stochastic models suggest that this proportionality condition holds broadly across fractal scale-free networks. We therefore conjecture that bifractality is a general property of fractal scale-free networks.\nFor details, see (Yamamoto and Yakubo 2023).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRandom walks on bifractal networks\n\n\n\nBuilding on the bifractality conjecture, we studied the walk and spectral dimensions of random walks on fractal scale-free networks. We found that the walk dimension d_{\\textup{w}}, which characterizes how the mean topological displacement of random walkers scales, remains constant across the network and does not depend on position.\nIn contrast, the spectral dimension, which governs the scaling of the return probability of a random walker, splits into two distinct values, d_{\\textup{s}}^{\\min} and d_{\\textup{s}}^{\\max}. This positional dependence arises directly from the network’s bifractal structure.\nFor details, see (Yakubo, Shimojo, and Yamamoto 2024)."
