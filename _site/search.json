    "title": "On the Four Knights Problem",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Thanks to Lovro Šubelj, I recently revisited the four knights problem for the first time in almost a decade.\nThe problem is as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem\n\n\n\nYou are given a section of a chessboard consisting of 10 squares. Two white knights and two black knights are placed on it. Your task is to swap the positions of the white and black knights using the fewest possible moves. Try to solve this within one minute.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Chessboard and positions of the 4 knights. [Credit: Lovro Šubelj]\n\n\n\n\n\nI was delighted to see this problem reappear as an introductory example in Lovro’s course on machine learning with graphs. It brought back memories, since this problem was one of the the first problems that drew me into graph theory a decade ago, back when I was still in high school. At the same time, I was surprised by how few students in our department knew about it. For me, the problem represents a prime example that demonstrates how graph (or network) representations can make certain problems far easier to approach than representations in Euclidean space. The lack of recognition (in our department) motivated me to write a blog post on the problem, in the hope of introducing more people to it.\nThe minimal solution of the problem is, to the best of my knowledge, 40 moves shown in Fig.2 as gif:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The solution with 40 moves.\n\n\n\nWhile the animated solution in Fig.2 looks quite intricate on the chessboard, it looks completely different when you represent the chessboard tiles as a graph with knight moves as edges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Graph representation of the chessboard.\n\n\n\nTo swap the positions of the black and white knights in the graph [Fig.3(b)], the strategy is clear:\n\nMove the three knights in the vertical branch to the left horizontal branch.\n\nWhite knight on vertex 3 \\rightarrow vertex 7 (4 steps)\nBlack knight on vertex 5 \\rightarrow vertex 2 (4 steps)\nBlack knight on vertex 9 \\rightarrow vertex 4 (4 steps)\n\nMove the white knight in the right branch (vertex 1) to the vertical branch.\n\nWhite knight on vertex 1 \\rightarrow vertex 9 (4 steps)\n\nMove the black knights in the left branch back to the vertical branch.\n\nBlack knight on vertex 4 \\rightarrow vertex 5 (3 steps)\nBlack knight on vertex 2 \\rightarrow vertex 3 (3 steps)\n\nMove the white knights in the left branch to the right branch.\n\nWhite knight on vertex 7 \\rightarrow vertex 1 (4 steps)\n\nMove the black knights in the vertical branch back to the left branch.\n\nBlack knight on vertex 3 \\rightarrow vertex 2 (3 steps)\nBlack knight on vertex 5 \\rightarrow vertex 4 (3 steps)\n\nMove the white knight in the right branch to the vertical branch.\n\nWhite knight on vertex 1 \\rightarrow vertex 5 (3 steps)\n\nMove the black knights in the left branch to the right and vertical branches.\n\nBlack knight on vertex 4 \\rightarrow vertex 1 or 3 (2 steps)\nBlack knight on vertex 2 \\rightarrow vertex 3 or 1 (3 steps)\n\n\nThe total number of steps adds up to 40 steps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Animation of the 40 moves in both the chessboard and the knight-move graph.\n\n\n\nIn Fig.4, what appeared to be complicated 40 moves on the chessboard is a series of short walks in a tree.\nWhy this matters\nMany real-world complex systems are spatially irregular: (i) The degrees (or coordination numbers) of their components vary considerably. (ii) Medium- to long-range connections/correlations often play critical roles in shaping their structure and dynamics. The four knights problem possess these two typical aspects of complex systems: not every square has the same degree, and knights moves to third (non-vertical/horizontal) neighbors rather than adjacent ones. Such dynamics are not intuitive in Euclidean space, but once projected onto a graph, their underlying simplicity often emerges.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

My research interests lie in the statistical physics of complex networks.\nI am working on spectral, topological, and dynamical aspects of physical networks, i.e., networks consisting of tangible nodes and edges that are embedded in Euclidean space. In particular, my PhD project is centered around the spectral properties of physical Laplacians formulated as node-weighted graph Laplacians that incorporate the physicality of nodes into combinatorial graph Laplacian, under the assumption of time scale separation between the internal and external dynamics of physical nodes. The ongoing projects include eigenmode delocalization in physical Laplacians and synchronization in networks of spin Hall nano-oscillators. I am supervised by Prof. Márton Pósfai and Prof. János Kertész.\nPrior to my PhD, I earned an MSc in Mathematics at Queen Mary University of London, where I worked with Prof. Ginestra Bianconi on higher-order network dynamics with triadic interactions.

Advances in imaging technologies and accelerated reconstruction by ML/AI have recently made it possible to obtain detailed three-dimensional maps of such complex systems, providing new opportunities for studying physical networks.\nIn recent years, the physical embedding of networks has been shown to give rise to emergent phenomena, including entanglement [(Liu, Dehmamy, and Barabási 2021), (Glover and Barabási 2024)], bundling (Bonamassa et al. 2024), jamming (Pósfai et al. 2024), and correlations between node degree and node volume (Pete et al. 2024).\nFor my PhD thesis, I am exploring the spectral and topological properties of physical networks, as well as the dynamical processes that unfold on them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocalization\n\n\n\nComing soon…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSynchronization\n\n\n\nComing soon…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMagnetization\n\n\n\nComing soon…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntanglement\n\n\n\nComing soon…"

Such interactions are ubiquitous in real-world systems, such as glia cells in the brain regulate synaptic connectivity between neurons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiffusion dynamics on networks with triadic interactions\n\n\n\nTo investigate how triadic interactions affect dynamics, we studied diffusion dynamics on networks incorporating triadic interactions under Gaussian noise. Our results show that these interactions generate conditional correlations and conditional mutual information among the three participating nodes, which in turn reveal both the strength and direction of the triadic interactions.\nWe further applied this framework as a null model to identify potential triadic interactions in gene regulatory networks.\nFor details, see (Baptista et al. 2024)."

    "text": "Fractal Scale-Free Networks\nA network is fractal (with respect to shortest-path lengths) if the minimum number of subgraphs (boxes) of diameter l_{\\textup{B}} required to cover the network scales as \\begin{equation}\n  N_{\\textup{B}}(l_{\\textup{B}}) \\sim l_{\\textup{B}}^{-D_{\\textup{f}}}\n\\end{equation} where D_{\\textup{f}} is the fractal dimension of the network (Song, Havlin, and Makse 2005). In fractal networks, the average path lengths also scales as the power of the network size, \\begin{equation}\n  \\langle l \\rangle \\sim N^{1/D_{\\textup{f}}}.\n\\end{equation} While many empirical networks exhibit the small-world property, where the average path lengths scales logarithmically with the number of nodes (corresponding to the absence of characteristic scales, i.e., D_{\\textup{f}} \\to \\infty), the fractal property can still hold at length scales shorter than the network’s characteristic size. Detecting this scaling through shortest paths, however, is often challenging because most real networks lack a sufficiently large diameter.\nFractal networks are of particular interest because their structure gives rise to distinctive features, such as long-range degree correlations manifested in hub repulsion (Rozenfeld et al. 2008).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBifractality\n\n\n\nWhen scale-free and fractal properties coexist, a broad class of networks exhibits bifractality, characterized by two distinct local fractal dimensions, d_{\\textup{f}}^{\\min} and d_{\\textup{f}}^{\\max} that depend on position within the network (Yamamoto and Yakubo 2023). In particular, consider a fractal scale-free network in which, under renormalization, the number of nodes \\nu_{\\textup{B}} in a supernode (subgraph) of diameter l_{\\textup{B}} is proportional to the degree k_{\\textup{B}} of that supernode (i.e., the number of adjacent subgraphs): \\begin{equation}\n  \\nu_{\\textup{B}} \\propto k_{\\textup{B}}.\n\\end{equation} Under this condition, the network exhibits two local fractal dimensions (equivalently, Hölder exponents): \\begin{equation}\n    d_{\\textup{f}}^{\\max} = D_{\\textup{f}}, \\quad d_{\\textup{f}}^{\\min} = D_{\\textup{f}} \\left(\\frac{\\gamma-2}{\\gamma-1}\\right),\n\\end{equation} where \\gamma is the exponent of the degree distribution and D_{\\textup{f}} is the global fractal dimension of the network.\nExtensive analytical and numerical calculations for both deterministic and stochastic models suggest that this proportionality condition holds broadly across fractal scale-free networks. We therefore conjecture that bifractality is a general property of fractal scale-free networks.\nFor details, see (Yamamoto and Yakubo 2023).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRandom walks on bifractal networks\n\n\n\nBuilding on the bifractality conjecture, we studied the walk and spectral dimensions of random walks on fractal scale-free networks. We found that the walk dimension d_{\\textup{w}}, which characterizes how the mean topological displacement of random walkers scales, remains constant across the network and does not depend on position.\nIn contrast, the spectral dimension, which governs the scaling of the return probability of a random walker, splits into two distinct values, d_{\\textup{s}}^{\\min} and d_{\\textup{s}}^{\\max}. This positional dependence arises directly from the network’s bifractal structure.\nFor details, see (Yakubo, Shimojo, and Yamamoto 2024)."
