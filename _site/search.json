    "text": "I am a PhD candidate at the Department of Network and Data Science at Central European University in Vienna, Austria, interested in statistical physics and complex networks.\nI am currently working on spectral and topological properties of physical networks, i.e., networks that are embedded in three-dimensional space under physical constraints (e.g., volume exclusion). I am supervised by Prof. Márton Pósfai and Prof. János Kertész.\nBefore starting my PhD, I completed Master of Science in Mathematics at Queen Mary University of London, with dissertation work on higher-order network dynamics in the presence of triadic interactions under the supervision of Prof. Ginestra Bianconi. I earned Bachelor of Engineering in Applied Physics at Hokkaido University in Sapporo, Japan, with thesis titled the bifractal property of fractal scale-free networks (supervised by Prof. Kousuke Yakubo).\n※日本語のプロファイルはこちらを参照して下さい．"
