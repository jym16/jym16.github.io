## Physical Networks

Physical networks are networks of tangible objects, in which nodes and edges are embedded in physical space and subject to constraints such as volume exclusion [[@dehmamy2018structural]]. 
Examples include biological neural networks, vascular systems, porous media, and granular materials.
Advances in imaging technologies and accelerated reconstruction by ML/AI have recently made it possible to obtain detailed three-dimensional maps of such complex systems, providing new opportunities for studying physical networks.

In recent years, the physical embedding of networks has been shown to give rise to emergent phenomena, including entanglement [[@liu2021isotopy], [@glover2024measuring]], bundling [@bonamassa2024logarithmic], jamming [@posfai2024impact], and correlations between node degree and node volume [@pete2024physical].

For my PhD thesis, I am exploring the spectral and topological properties of physical networks, as well as the dynamical processes that unfold on them.

## Higher-Order Networks

Triadic interactions are higher-order, three-body interactions in which a node modulates the edge between two other nodes. 
Such interactions are ubiquitous in real-world systems, such as  glia cells in the brain regulate synaptic connectivity between neurons. 

::: {.callout-note title="Diffusion dynamics on networks with triadic interactions"}

To investigate how triadic interactions affect dynamics, we studied diffusion dynamics on networks incorporating triadic interactions under Gaussian noise. 
Our results show that these interactions generate conditional correlations and conditional mutual information among the three participating nodes, which in turn reveal both the strength and direction of the triadic interactions.

We further applied this framework as a null model to identify potential triadic interactions in gene regulatory networks.

## Fractal Scale-Free Networks

A network is *fractal* (with respect to shortest-path lengths) if the minimum number of subgraphs (boxes) of diameter $l_{\textup{B}}$ required to cover the network scales as
\begin{equation}
  N_{\textup{B}}(l_{\textup{B}}) \sim l_{\textup{B}}^{-D_{\textup{f}}}
\end{equation}
where $D_{\textup{f}}$ is the fractal dimension of the network [@song2005self]. 
In fractal networks, the average path lengths also scales as the power of the network size, 
\begin{equation}
  \langle l \rangle \sim N^{1/D_{\textup{f}}}.
\end{equation}
While many empirical networks exhibit the *small-world* property, where the average path lengths scales logarithmically with the number of nodes (corresponding to the absence of characteristic scales, i.e., $D_{\textup{f}} \to \infty$), the fractal property can still hold at length scales shorter than the network's characteristic size. 
Detecting this scaling through shortest paths, however, is often challenging because most real networks lack a sufficiently large diameter.

Fractal networks are of particular interest because their structure gives rise to distinctive features, such as long-range degree correlations manifested in *hub repulsion* [@rozenfeld2008fractal].

::: {.callout-note title="Bifractality"}

When scale-free and fractal properties coexist, a broad class of networks exhibits *bifractality*, characterized by two distinct local fractal dimensions, $d_{\textup{f}}^{\min}$ and $d_{\textup{f}}^{\max}$ that depend on position within the network [@yamamoto2023bifractality].
In particular, consider a fractal scale-free network in which, under renormalization, the number of nodes $\nu_{\textup{B}}$ in a supernode (subgraph) of diameter $l_{\textup{B}}$ is proportional to the degree $k_{\textup{B}}$ of that supernode (i.e., the number of adjacent subgraphs):
\begin{equation}
  \nu_{\textup{B}} \propto k_{\textup{B}}.
\end{equation}
Under this condition, the network exhibits two local fractal dimensions (equivalently, Hölder exponents):
\begin{equation}
    d_{\textup{f}}^{\max} = D_{\textup{f}}, \quad d_{\textup{f}}^{\min} = D_{\textup{f}} \left(\frac{\gamma-2}{\gamma-1}\right),
\end{equation}
where $\gamma$ is the exponent of the degree distribution and $D_{\textup{f}}$ is the global fractal dimension of the network.

Extensive analytical and numerical calculations for both deterministic and stochastic models suggest that this proportionality condition holds broadly across fractal scale-free networks. 
We therefore conjecture that bifractality is a general property of fractal scale-free networks.

::: {.callout-tip title="Random walks on bifractal networks"}

Building on the bifractality conjecture, we studied the walk and spectral dimensions of random walks on fractal scale-free networks. 
We found that the walk dimension $d_{\textup{w}}$, which characterizes how the mean topological displacement of random walkers scales, remains constant across the network and does not depend on position.

In contrast, the spectral dimension, which governs the scaling of the return probability of a random walker, splits into two distinct values, $d_{\textup{s}}^{\min}$ and $d_{\textup{s}}^{\max}$. 
This positional dependence arises directly from the network’s bifractal structure.
