## Physical Networks

Physical networks are networks of tangible objects, i.e., nodes and edges are embedded in a physical space under volume exclusion principle [[@dehmamy2018structural], [@liu2021isotopy], [@posfai2024impact], [@pete2024physical], [@blagojevic2024three], [@glover2024measuring]]. 
Examples of physical networks include biological neural networks, vascular networks, porous media, granular materials, and so on.
The recent advances of imaging techniques and machine learning methods for image segmentation have significantly improved the availablity of complex three-dimensional data of physical systems, which drives the study of physical networks.

Over the recent years, the physicality of the network has been shown to result in the emergent properties such as entanglement [[@liu2021isotopy], [@glover2024measuring]], bundling [@bonamassa2024logarithmic], jamming [@posfai2024impact], and degree-volume correlations [@pete2024physical].

### Diffusion dynamics on networks with triadic interactions

Triadic interactions are interactions in which a node can regulate an edge between two other nodes either positively or negatively. 
Such interactions are ubiquitous in real-world networks, such as glia cells in the brain that regulate the connectivity between neurons.

In order to understand the role of triadic interactions in diffusion processes, we investigated the diffusion dynamics on networks of $N$ nodes with triadic interactions and Gaussian noise:
\begin{equation}
  d\mathbf{x}(t) = - (\mathbf{L}^{\textup{T}} + \alpha \mathbf{I}) \mathbf{x}(t) dt + \mathbf{\Gamma} d\mathbf{\eta}(t),
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{x}(t)$ is the state vector of nodes at time $t$, $\mathbf{L}^{\textup{T}}$ is the triadic Laplacian matrix, and $d\mathbf{\eta}$ is the $N$-dimensional Wiener process.
The triadic Laplacian matrix $\mathbf{L}^{\textup{T}}$ is defined as
\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{L}^{\textup{T}}_{ij} = \begin{cases}
    - A_{ij} J_{ij}(\mathbf{x}) & \text{if } i \neq j, \\
    \sum_{k} A_{ik} J_{ik}(\mathbf{x}) & \text{if } i = j,
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{A}$ is the adjacency matrix and $J_{ij}(\mathbf{x})$ is the coupling strength between nodes $i$ and $j$ that are determined by all the regulatory nodes of the edge $[i,j]$:
\begin{equation}
  J_{ij}(\mathbf{x}) = w_{-} + (w_{+} - w_{-}) \theta \left(\sum_{k} K_{lk} x_{k} - \hat{T}\right),
\end{equation}
where $\theta$ is the Heaviside step function and $K_{lk}$ encodes the sign of the triadic interaction between edge $l$ and node $k$.

We apply this model as well as information theoretic measures as a null model to detect the presence of triadic interactions in gene regulatory networks.

## Fractal Scale-Free Networks

A network is *fractal* if the minimum number of subgraphs (boxes) of a given diameter $l_{\textup{B}}$ required to cover the network scales as
\begin{equation}
  N_{\textup{B}}(l_{\textup{B}}) \sim l_{\textup{B}}^{-D_{\textup{f}}}
\end{equation}
where $D_{\textup{f}}$ is the fractal dimension of the network [@song2005self]. 
In fractal networks, the average path lengths also scales as the power-law of the network size, i.e.,
\begin{equation}
  \langle l \rangle \sim N^{1/D_{\textup{f}}}.
\end{equation}
While many empirical networks are shown to be *small-world*, in which the average path lengths scales as logarithm of the number of nodes, i.e., $D_{\textup{f}} \to \infty$, the fractality can still be valid in length scale shorter than the characteristic length scale of the network (although it is difficult to observe the scaling for a decade or more in terms of shortest path lengths, as most of the networks do not have long enough diameter).

Putting aside the issue of observability of network fractality, networks with fractal structure exhibit intrigueing properties, such as the long-range degree correlations in the form of *hub repulsion* [@rozenfeld2008fractal].

### Bifractality

We showed that, in the coexistence of scale-free and fractal properties, a broad class of networks exhibits *bifractality*, characterized by the coexistence of two different local fractal dimensions, $D_{\textup{f}}^{\min}$ and $D_{\textup{f}}^{\max}$ depending on the position in the network [@yamamoto2023bifractality].
In particular, if a fractal scale-free network satisfies the condition that the number of nodes in a supernode (subgraph) of diameter $l_{\textup{B}}$ is proportional to the degree of the supernode in the renormalization process, i.e.,
\begin{equation}
  \nu_{\textup{B}} \propto k_{\textup{B}},
\end{equation}
then the network contains the local fractal dimension (equivalent to H\"{o}lder exponent) 
\begin{equation}
    d_{\textup{f}}^{\max} = D_{\textup{f}}, \quad d_{\textup{f}}^{\min} = D_{\textup{f}} \left(\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma-2}\right),
\end{equation}
where $\gamma$ is the exponent of the degree distribution and $D_{\textup{f}}$ is the (global) fractal dimension of the network.

From our extensive considerations of deterministic and stochastic models, the above condition seems to stand for any fractal scale-free networks and we conjectured that the bifractality is a generic property of fractal scale-free networks.

To learn more about the bifractality, see [@yamamoto2023bifractality].

### Random walks

Following the bifractality conjecture, we investigated the the walk and spectral dimensions of random walks on fractal scale-free networks. 
We found that the walk dimension $d_{\textup{w}}$ of random walks on fractal scale-free networks (which characterizes the scaling of the mean topological displacement of random walkers) is constant and does not depend on the position in the network, while the spectral dimension (that determines the scaling of the return probability of a random walker) takes two distinct values, $d_{\textup{s}}^{\min}$ and $d_{\textup{s}}^{\max}$, depending on the position in the network due to the bifractality of the network.
