## Physical Networks

Physical networks are networks of tangible objects, i.e., nodes and edges are embedded in a physical space under physical constraints including but not limited to volume exclusion [[@dehmamy2018structural]]. 
Examples of physical networks include biological neural networks, vascular networks, porous media, granular materials, to name just a few [[@blagojevic2024three]].
The recent advances of imaging techniques and machine learning have significantly improved the availablity of three-dimensional maps of complex physical systems, which motivates the study of physical networks.

Over the recent years, the physicality of the network has been shown to result in the emergent properties such as entanglement [[@liu2021isotopy], [@glover2024measuring]], bundling [@bonamassa2024logarithmic], jamming [@posfai2024impact], and degree-volume correlations [@pete2024physical].

For my PhD thesis, I am investigating the spectral and topological properties of physical networks, as well as dynamical processes on physical networks.

## Higher-Order Networks

Triadic interactions are three-body (higher-order) interactions in which a node regulates an edge between two other nodes positively or negatively. 
Such interactions are ubiquitous in real-world networks, such as glia cells in the brain that regulate the connectivity between neurons.

::: {.callout-note title="Diffusion dynamics on networks with triadic interactions"}

In order to understand the role of triadic interactions in diffusion processes, we investigated the diffusion dynamics on networks with triadic interactions and Gaussian noise and demonstrated that triadic interactions induce conditional correlation and conditional mutual information between the three nodes involved in the triadic interaction and provide information on the strength and direction of the triadic interactions. 
We applied this model as a null model to detect the presence of triadic interactions in gene regulatory networks.

## Fractal Scale-Free Networks

A network is *fractal* (with respect to shortest-path lengths) if the minimum number of subgraphs (boxes) of a given diameter $l_{\textup{B}}$ required to cover the network scales as
\begin{equation}
  N_{\textup{B}}(l_{\textup{B}}) \sim l_{\textup{B}}^{-D_{\textup{f}}}
\end{equation}
where $D_{\textup{f}}$ is the fractal dimension of the network [@song2005self]. 
In fractal networks, the average path lengths also scales as the power-law of the network size, i.e.,
\begin{equation}
  \langle l \rangle \sim N^{1/D_{\textup{f}}}.
\end{equation}
While many empirical networks are shown to be *small-world*, in which the average path lengths scales as logarithm of the number of nodes, i.e., $D_{\textup{f}} \to \infty$, the fractality can still be valid in length scale shorter than the characteristic length scale of the network (although it is difficult to observe the scaling in terms of shortest path lengths, as most of the networks do not have long enough diameter).

Networks with fractal structure exhibit intriguing properties, such as the long-range degree correlations in the form of *hub repulsion* [@rozenfeld2008fractal].

::: {.callout-note title="Bifractality"}

In the coexistence of scale-free and fractal properties, a broad class of networks exhibits *bifractality*, characterized by the coexistence of two different local fractal dimensions, $d_{\textup{f}}^{\min}$ and $d_{\textup{f}}^{\max}$ depending on the position in the network [@yamamoto2023bifractality].
In particular, if a fractal scale-free network satisfies the condition that the number $\nu_{\textup{B}}$ of nodes in a supernode (subgraph) of diameter $l_{\textup{B}}$ is proportional to the degree $k_{\textup{B}}$ of the supernode (the number of adjacent subgraphs) in the renormalization process (the number of adjacent subgraphs), i.e.,
\begin{equation}
  \nu_{\textup{B}} \propto k_{\textup{B}},
\end{equation}
then the network contains the local fractal dimension (equivalent to H\"{o}lder exponent) 
\begin{equation}
    d_{\textup{f}}^{\max} = D_{\textup{f}}, \quad d_{\textup{f}}^{\min} = D_{\textup{f}} \left(\frac{\gamma-2}{\gamma-1}\right),
\end{equation}
where $\gamma$ is the exponent of the degree distribution and $D_{\textup{f}}$ is the (global) fractal dimension of the network.

From extensive considerations of deterministic and stochastic models, the above condition seems to stand for any fractal scale-free networks and we conjectured that the bifractality is a generic property of fractal scale-free networks.

To learn more about the bifractality, see [@yamamoto2023bifractality].

::: {.callout-tip title="Random walks on bifractal networks"}

Following the bifractality conjecture, we investigated the the walk and spectral dimensions of random walks on fractal scale-free networks. 
We found that the walk dimension $d_{\textup{w}}$ of random walks on fractal scale-free networks (which characterizes the scaling of the mean topological displacement of random walkers) is constant and does not depend on the position in the network, while the spectral dimension (that determines the scaling of the return probability of a random walker) takes two distinct values, $d_{\textup{s}}^{\min}$ and $d_{\textup{s}}^{\max}$, depending on the position in the network due to the bifractality of the network.
